#    Introduction
       The project Tuition center management system is a desktop based application system. Designed using the python and tkinter module. Using the Sqlite3 for the storage system.  This is especially designed for the small organization like the Education institute to keep their student records.

1.	Python: Is used as the main programing language to write the code.
2.	Pycharm: It is used as the Interpreter to run the python code.
3.	Tkinter: It is used as the python integration to create the graphical user interface.
4.	GitHub: It is used as the platform for the code back up.
5.	Microsoft Office 365: It is used as the platform for writing and sharing documentation.
6.	Sqlite3: It is used as the data storage for the data given in the program.
7.	YouTube: It is uses as a platform to upload and share the project video.

# Scope of the project
            The main scope of this management system is to allow any institution to perform Data management in more effective way.

# After Implementation
  The small organization like tution centre will get benifit inuswd of it. 
  This project is user friendly so that any one without the knowledge of programming can also used.
